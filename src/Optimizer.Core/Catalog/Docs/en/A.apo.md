# Intel Application Optimization (APO)

## Summary
::: status Info
{{cpu}} supports Intel APO, which changes how supported games use the cores. It needs the Dynamic Tuning driver; the APO app is optional.
:::
::: status Ok,Unknown,Problem,Unsupported
Checks whether the processor supports Intel Application Optimization.
:::

## Why it matters
Intel APO directs how a supported game's threads are spread over performance and efficient cores. Intel publishes a list of supported games and says APO may improve their performance; it works only for the titles on that list [1]. Intel names verified processors, for example Core i5-14600K, i7-14700K, i9-14900K, Core Ultra 200S K models and some mobile HX and H models; other 12th gen and newer processors get only limited support [1]. APO runs as part of the Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology (DTT) driver, which comes from the PC or mainboard maker [1].
::: variant dttFound
The Dynamic Tuning driver is installed on this PC.
:::
::: variant dttNotFound
We did not find the Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology services we look for. That does not prove the driver is missing: it may use a name we do not know.
:::

## How we detected it
We match the processor name with the list of verified models and look for the Dynamic Tuning services. Whether APO is active cannot be read reliably.

## How to fix
::: ifnot laptop
1. Install the **Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology** driver from the support page of your mainboard ({{board}}). It is board specific, so it does not come from Intel directly [1].

::: if laptop
1. Install the **Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology** driver from the laptop maker's support page or app. It is specific to the device, so it does not come from Intel directly [1].

2. **BitLocker:** if BitLocker or device encryption is on, suspend protection first (Start > **Manage BitLocker** > **Suspend protection**) or have the recovery key ready; it is often saved in your Microsoft account. A BIOS update or a change to the TPM or the boot configuration can make Windows ask for it at the next start [2][3].
3. Keep the BIOS current and check that Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology or Intel Platform Innovation Framework (IPF) is enabled in it. Most systems have IPF on by default; the menu name differs between boards [1].
4. Optional: download the **Intel Application Optimization** app from the Intel Download Center to see the supported games and turn APO on or off per game [1].

## How to check the fix
The APO app lists the supported games and shows whether APO is active.
