# Remove forced platform clock (useplatformclock)

## Summary
Expert, boot configuration: removes useplatformclock, a debugging option that older guides set. It forces a slower platform timer; removing it lets Windows pick its timer again.

## How it works
The boot option useplatformclock forces Windows to use the platform clock as its performance counter; Microsoft says it should only be used for debugging [1]. The platform clock is the HPET or the ACPI PM timer. Normally Windows uses the CPU's time stamp counter (TSC) when it is suitable [2]. The app deletes the option after exporting the boot configuration.

## Why it can help
Reading the TSC takes tens to a few hundred CPU cycles. Reading a platform timer takes about 0.8 to 1.0 microseconds and needs a system call [2]. Games query the time many times per frame, so the difference adds up.

## Evidence
The cost difference is documented by Microsoft [2]. How much it changes the frame rate depends on how often a game queries the time.

## Trade-offs & risks
A boot configuration change. If BitLocker is on, keep your recovery key at hand: Microsoft notes that BitLocker may need to be suspended before changing boot options [1]. If the PC does not start correctly, System Restore does not help, because it does not restore the boot configuration. Open the recovery environment (Shift + Restart > Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Command Prompt) and run `bcdedit /deletevalue {default} useplatformclock` to remove the setting again [1][3]. The app also exports the whole boot configuration before the change into its data folder; `bcdedit /import <file>` restores it from there [3].

## When not to use it
Nothing to do if the option is not set. Only change boot settings with physical access to the PC.
