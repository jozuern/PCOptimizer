# Windows Search: no web results and no location

## Summary
Windows Search no longer searches the web or shows web results and may not use your location. Pro, Enterprise and Education.

## How it works
Three Windows Search policies Microsoft lists for limiting connections: "Do not allow web search" (DisableWebSearch = 1), "Don't search the web or display web results in Search" (ConnectedSearchUseWeb = 0) and "Allow search to use location" set to 0 [1][2]. They complement the tweak "No web results in Windows Search", which uses the newer search box policy.

## Why it can help
What you type into Search stays on the PC, and Search cannot use your location for results.

## Evidence
Documented Windows policies [1][2]. A privacy setting without effect on frame rate or latency.

## Trade-offs & risks
Search finds only apps, settings and files on this PC; for web results you open a browser.

## When not to use it
If you use web results in Windows Search.
