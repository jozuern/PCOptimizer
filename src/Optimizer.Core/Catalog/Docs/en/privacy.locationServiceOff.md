# Location service off for everything

## Summary
Turns the Windows location service off for all apps, Search and Windows itself, and locks the location settings. Stronger than denying apps access. Pro, Enterprise and Education.

## How it works
The policy "Turn off location" (DisableLocation = 1) is Force Location Off: all location privacy settings are turned off and grayed out, and no app may use the location service, including Search [1][2]. Switching back to user control restores each app's earlier setting [1].

## Why it can help
No app or Windows feature can read where the PC is. The tweak "Location access for apps off" only changes the default for apps; this policy also covers Windows features and cannot be overridden in Settings.

## Evidence
A documented Windows policy [1][2]. A privacy setting without effect on frame rate or latency.

## Trade-offs & risks
Apps and Windows features that use your location, such as maps, weather and Find my device, can no longer get it. Undo returns control to Settings [1].

## When not to use it
If you use location in maps, weather or Find my device.
